## Event Log Format


***Modern Windows systems store logs in the `` %SystemRoot%\System32\winevt\logs `` directory by
default in the binary XML Windows Event Logging format, designated by the ``.evtx`` extension.***

***Log Name: The name of the Event Log where the event is stored. Useful when processing
numerous logs pulled from the same system.***

***Source: The service, Microsoft component or application that generated the event.***

***Event ID: A code assigned to each type of audited activity.***

***Level: The severity assigned to the event in question.***

***User: The user account involved in triggering the activity or the user context that the source was running as when it logged the event. Note that this field often indicates “System” or a user that is not the cause of the event being recorded.***

* _OpCode: Assigned by the source generating the log. Its meaning is left to the source._

* _Logged: The local system date and time when the event was logged._

* _Task Category: Assigned by the source generating the log. Its meaning is left to the source._

* _Keywords: Assigned by the source and used to group or sort events._

***Computer: The computer on which the event was logged. This is useful when examining logs collected from multiple systems, but should not be considered to be the device that caused an event (such as when a remote logon is initiated, the Computer field will still show the name of the system logging the event, not the source of the connection).***

***Description: A text block where additional information specific to the event being logged is
recorded. This is often the most significant field for the analyst.***

### Account Logon and Logon Events

***Account Logon is the Microsoft term for authentication. Logon is the term used to refer to an
account gaining access to a resource. Both Account Logon and Logon events will be recorded in
the Security event log. Authentication (account logon) of domain accounts is performed by a
domain controller within a Windows network. Local accounts (those that exist within a local SAM
file rather than as a part of Active Directory) are authenticated by the local system where they exist.**
**Account logon events will be logged by the system that performs the authentication. Auditing of
Account Logon and Logon events is easily set by Group Policy. While Microsoft continues to
enable more logging by default as new versions of Windows are released, administrators should 
review their audit policies on a regular basis to ensure that all systems are generating adequate logs.
The ability to store event logs on remote systems (either using the native Microsoft remote logging
features or third-party SIEM tools or other tools) helps safeguard logs from alteration or
destruction.***

* _Event IDs of particular interest on domain controllers, which authenticate domain users, include:_

>### Event ID 4768
>#### Description
***The successful issuance of a TGT shows that a user account was authenticated by the
domain controller. The Network Information section of the event description contains
additional information about the remote host in the event of a remote logon attempt.
The Keywords field indicates whether the authentication attempt was successful or
failed. In the event of a failed authentication attempt, the result code in the event
description provides additional information about the reason for the failure, as
specified in RFC 4120. Some of the more commonly encountered codes are:***
	
##
	
	Common Event ID 4768 result codes
	
	Decimal 	Hex 		Meaning
	6 			0x6 		Username not valid.
	12 			0xC		Policy restriction prohibiting this logon (such as a workstation restriction or timeof-day restriction).
	18 			0x12 		The account is locked out, disabled, or expired.
	23 			0x17 		The account’s password is expired.
	24 			0x18 		The password is incorrect.
	32 			0x20 		The ticket has expired (common on computer accounts).
	37 			0x25 		The clock skew is too great.

>#### Event ID		4769

>##### Description:

***A service ticket was requested by a user account for a specified resource. This event
description shows the source IP of the system that made the request, the user account
used, and the service to be accessed. These events provide a useful source of evidence as
they track authenticated user access across the network.***


>#### Event ID	4770

>##### Description:
***A service ticket was renewed. The account name, service name, client IP address, and
encryption type are recorded.***

>#### Event ID	4771

>##### Description:
***Depending on the reason for a failed Kerberos logon, either Event ID 4768 or Event ID
4771 is created. In either case, the result code in the event description provides additional
information about the reason for the failure.***

>#### Event ID	4776

>##### Description:
***This event ID is recorded for NTLM authentication attempts. The Network Information
section of the event description contains additional information about the remote host in
the event of a remote logon attempt. The Keywords field indicates whether the
authentication attempt succeeded or failed.***


**Common Event ID 4776 error code descriptions**

	Error Code 		Meaning
	0xC0000064 		The username is incorrect.
	0xC000006A 		The password is incorrect.
	0xC000006D		Generic logon failure. Possibly bad username or password or mismatch in the LAN Manager 		Authentication Level between the source and target computers.

	0xC0000234 		Account logon with account locked.
	0xc0000371 		The local account store does not contain secret material for the specified account.


#### _On systems being accessed, Event IDs of note include:_

>#### Event ID	4624

>##### Description:
***A logon to a system has occurred. Type 2 indicates an interactive (usually local) logon,
whereas a Type 3 indicates a remote or network logon. The event description will
contain information about the host and account name involved. For remote logons,
focus on the Network Information section of the event description for remote host 
information.***


### Logon event type code descriptions

	Logon Type		Description
		2				Interactive, such as logon at keyboard and screen of the system, or remotely using thirdparty remote access tools like VNC, or psexec with the -u switch. Logons of this type will cache the user’s credentials in RAM for the duration of the session and may cache the user’s credentials on disk.
		3				Network, such as access to a shared folder on this computer from elsewhere on the network. This represents a noninteractive logon, which does not cache the user’s credentials in RAM or on disk
		4				Batch (indicating a scheduled task). Batch logon type is used by batch servers, where processes may be executing on behalf of a user without their direct intervention.
		5				Service indicates that a service was started by the Service Control Manager.
		7				Unlock indicates that an unattended workstation with a password protected screen is unlocked.
		8				NetworkCleartext indicates that a user logged on to this computer from the network and the user’s password was passed to the authentication package in its unhashed form. The built-in authentication packages all hash credentials before sending them across the network. The credentials do not traverse the network in plaintext (also called cleartext). Most often indicates a logon to Internet Information Services (IIS) with basic authentication
		9				NewCredentials indicates that a user logged on with alternate credentials to perform actions such as with RunAs or mapping a network drive. If you want to track users attempting to log on with alternate credentials, also look for Event ID 4648.
		10				RemoteInteractive indicates that Terminal Services, Remote Desktop, or Remote Assistance for an interactive logon. See the note on RDP at the end of this section for more details.
		11				CachedInteractive (logon with cached domain credentials such as when logging on to a laptop when away from the network). The domain controller was not contacted to verify the credential, so no account logon entry is generated.


>#### Event ID	4625

>##### Description
***A failed logon attempt. Large numbers of these throughout a network may be indicative of
password guessing or password spraying attacks. Again, the Network Information section of
the event description can provide valuable information about a remote host attempting to log
on to the system. Note that failed logons over RDP may log as Type 3 rather than Type 10,
depending on the systems involved. You can determine more about the reason for the
failure by consulting the Failure Information section of the event description.***

#### The status code found in Event ID 4625 provides additional details about the event:

					Common logon failure status codes
		
	Status code 			Description
		
	0XC000005E 			Currently no logon servers are available to service the logon request.
	0xC0000064 			User logon with misspelled or bad user account.
	0xC000006A 			User logon with misspelled or bad password.
	0XC000006D 			This is either due to a bad username or incorrect authentication information.
	0XC000006E 			Unknown username or bad password.
	0xC000006F 			User logon outside authorized hours.
	0xC0000070 			User logon from unauthorized workstation.
	0xC0000071 			User logon with expired password.
	0xC0000072 			User logon to account disabled by administrator.
	0XC00000DC 			Indicates the Server was in the wrong state to perform the desired operation.
	0XC0000133 			Clocks between domain controller and other computer too far out of sync.
	0XC000015B			The user has not been granted the requested logon type (also known as logon right) at this machine.
	0XC000018C			The logon request failed because the trust relationship between the primary domain and the trusted domain failed.
	0XC0000192			An attempt was made to log on, but the Netlogon service was not started.
	0xC0000193 			User logon with expired account.
	0XC0000224 			User is required to change password at next logon.
	0XC0000225 			Evidently a bug in Windows and not a risk.
	0xC0000234 			User logon with account locked.
	0XC00002EE 			Failure Reason: An error occurred during logon.
	0XC0000413			Logon Failure: The machine you are logging on to is protected by an authentication firewall. The specified account is not allowed to authenticate to the machine.
	
	
>#### Event ID	4634/4647

>##### Description
***User logoff is recorded by Event ID 4634 or Event ID 4647. The lack of an event
showing a logoff should not be considered overly suspicious, as Windows is
inconsistent in logging Event ID 4634 in many cases. The Logon ID field can be used to
tie the Event ID 4624 logon event with the associated logoff event (the Logon ID is
unique between reboots on the same computer).***


>#### Event ID	4648

>##### Description
***A logon was attempted using explicit credentials. When a user attempts to use
credentials other than the ones used for the current logon session (including bypassing
User Account Control [UAC] to open a process with administrator permissions), this
event is logged.***

>#### Event ID	4672

>##### Description
***This event ID is recorded when certain privileges associated with elevated or
administrator access are granted to a logon. As with all logon events, the event log will
be generated by the system being accessed.***

>#### Event ID	4778
>#### Description
***This event is logged when a session is reconnected to a Windows station. This can occur
locally when the user context is switched via fast user switching.***

>#### Event ID	4779
>##### Description
***This event is logged when a session is disconnected. This can occur locally when the
user context is switched via fast user switching. It can also occur when a session is
reconnected over RDP. A full logoff from an RDP session is logged with Event ID 4637
or 4647 as mentioned earlier.***



### Access to Shared Objects
		
***Attackers frequently leverage valid credentials to remotely access data through user created or
administrative shares. Doing so will generate Account Logon and Logon events as mentioned
above, but additional logging can also be enabled in the Group Policy Management Console by
navigating to Computer Configuration -> Policies -> Windows Settings -> Security Settings -> 
Advanced Audit Policy Configuration -> Audit Policies -> Object Access -> Audit File Share.
Once enabled, the following Event IDs will be logged in the Security Log:***



### Network share event IDs
		
>#### Event ID	5140

>##### Description
***A network share object was accessed. The event entry provides the account name and
source address of the account that accessed the object. Note that this entry will show that
the share was accessed but not what files in the share were accessed. A large number of
these events from a single account may be an indicator of an account being used to
harvest or map data on the network.***

>#### Event ID	5142

>##### Description
***A network share object was added.***

>#### Event ID	5143

>##### Description
***A network share object was modified.***

>#### Event ID	5144
>##### Description
***A network share object was deleted. A network share object was checked to see whether client can be granted desired access.***

>#### Event ID	5145
>##### Description
***Failure is only logged if the permission is denied at the file share level. If permission is
denied at the NTFS level then no entry is recorded.***

***If detailed file share auditing is enabled in the Group Policy Management Console by navigating to
``Computer Configuration -> Policies -> Windows Settings -> Security Settings -> Advanced Audit
Policy Configuration -> Audit Policies -> Object Access -> Audit Detailed File Share``, then each
file within each share that is accessed will generate an Event ID 5145 log entry. As you can
imagine, this level of logging may generate a large volume of results.***
***The system initiating the access may also show evidence of the connections in the registry key***

```
NTUSER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\MountPoints2
```

#### Scheduled Task Logging
		
If history is enabled in the Task Scheduler application, through Event Viewer, or with the wevtutil
command, then the
``
%SystemRoot%\System32\winevt\Logs\Microsoft-Windows- TaskScheduler%4Operational
``
log will record activity relating to scheduled tasks on the local system as follows:

>#### Event ID 106

>##### Description
***Scheduled Task Created. The entry shows the user account that scheduled the task and
the name the user assigned to the task. The Logged date and time show when the task
was scheduled. Look for the associated Event ID 200 and 201 for additional
information.***

>#### Event ID 140
>##### Description
***Scheduled Task Updated. The entry shows the user account that updated the task and
the name of the task. The Logged date and time show when the task was updated. Look
for the associated Event ID 200 and 201 for additional information.***

>#### Event ID 141
>##### Description
***Scheduled Task Deleted. The entry shows the user account that deleted the task and the
name of the task.***

>#### Event ID 200
>##### Description
***Scheduled Task Executed. Shows the task name and the full path to the executable on
disk that was run (listed as the Action). Correlate this with the associated Event ID 106
to determine the user account that scheduled the task.***

>#### Event ID 201
>##### Description
***Scheduled Task Completed. Shows the task name and the full path to the executable on
disk that was run (listed as the Action). Correlate this with the associated Event ID 106
to determine the user account that scheduled the task.
Also, see the Object Access Auditing section for additional Event IDs that may be recorded in
relation to scheduled tasks.***

_Also, see the Object Access Auditing section for additional Event IDs that may be recorded in
relation to scheduled tasks._


		
### Object Access Auditing

***Object access auditing is not enabled by default but should be enabled on sensitive systems. To do
so, simply set use the Local Security Policy to set Security Settings -> Local Policies -> Audit
Policy -> Audit object access to Enabled for Success and Failure.
Object access audit events are stored in the Security log. If object access auditing is enabled,
scheduled tasks get additional logging. The Event IDs related to scheduled tasks are:***


>#### Event ID 4698
>##### Description
***A scheduled task was created. The event description contains the user account that created
the task in the Subject section. XML details of the scheduled task are also recorded in the
event description under the Task Description section and includes the Task Name.***

>#### Event ID 4699
>##### Description
***A scheduled task was deleted. The Subject section of the event description contains the
Account Name that deleted the task as well as the Task Name.***

>#### Event ID 4700 
>##### Description
***A scheduled task was enabled. See Event ID 4698 for additional details.***

>#### Event ID 4701 
>##### Description
***A scheduled task was disabled. See Event ID 4698 for additional details.***

>#### Event ID 4702
>##### Description
***A scheduled task was updated. The user who initiated the update appears in the Subject
section of the event description. The details of the task after its modification are listed in the
XML in the event description. Compare with previous Event ID 4702 or 4698 entries for
this task to determine what changes were made. See Event ID 4698 for additional details.***



***Aside from scheduled tasks, individual file objects are frequently audited for object access. In
addition to enabling the option for Success and/or Failure for Audit Object Access as mentioned
earlier, to audit access to individual files or folders you also need to explicitly set the auditing rules
in the file or folder’s Properties. dialog box by selecting the Security tab, clicking Advanced,
selecting the Auditing tab, and setting the type of audit and the user account(s) for which auditing
should be set. Detailed instructions can be found here:***
```
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/auditing/apply-a-basic-auditpolicy-on-a-file-or-folder
```
***For a process to use a system object, such as a file, it must obtain a handle to that object. Once
auditing is enabled, the event IDs described below can be used to view access to important files and
folders by tracking the issuance and use of handles to those objects.***



### Object handle event IDs
		
>#### Event ID 4656
>#### Description
***A handle to an object was requested. When a process attempts to gain a handle to an
audited object, this event is created. The details of the object to which the handle was 
requested and the handle ID assigned to the handle are listed in the Object section of the
event description.***

>#### Event ID 4657
>#### Description
***A registry value was modified. The user account and process responsible for opening the
handle are listed in the event description.***

>#### Event ID 4658
>##### Description
***The handle to an object was closed. The user account and process responsible for
opening the handle are listed in the event description. To determine the object itself, refer
to the preceding Event ID 4656 with the same Handle ID.***

>#### Event ID 4660
>##### Description
***An object was deleted. The user account and process responsible for opening the handle
are listed in the event description. To determine the object itself, refer to the preceding
Event ID 4656 with the same Handle ID.***

>#### Event ID 4663
>##### Description
***An attempt was made to access an object. This event is logged when a process attempts
to interact with an object, rather than just obtain a handle to the object. This can be used
to help determine what types of actions may have been taken on an object (for example,
read only or modify data). See Event ID 4656 for additional details.***


***Since Windows 8/Server 2012, additional logging can also be enabled in the Group Policy
Management Console by navigating to Computer Configuration -> Policies -> Windows Settings ->
Security Settings -> Advanced Audit Policy Configuration -> Audit Policies -> Object Access ->
Audit Removeable Storage. Once enabled, Windows will create additional Event ID 4663 entries
(see above) whenever an account access a file system object that is on removable storage. This can
help identify when users are copying data to or from external media.***




### Audit Policy Changes
		
***When audit policy changes, it impacts the evidence available to investigators and incident handlers,
whether the change was done maliciously by an attacker or legitimately by an administrator.
Fortunately, modern Windows systems do a good job of logging these changes when they occur.
The Event ID used for this auditing is 4719:***

``4719`` – ***System audit policy was changed. The Audit Policy Change section will list the
specific changes that were made to the audit policy. The Subject section of the event
description may show the account that made the change, but often (such as when the change
is made through Group Policy) this section simply reports the name of the local system.***


``1102`` – ***Regardless of the settings in the audit policy, if the Security event log is cleared,
Event ID 1102 will be recorded as the first entry in the new, blank log. You can tell the 
name of the user account that cleared the log in the details of the entry. A similar event,
with ID 104, is generated in the System log if it is cleared.***


### Auditing Windows Services

***Many attacks rely on Windows services either for executing commands remotely or for maintaining
persistence on systems. While most of the events we have mentioned so far have been found in the
Security Event Log, Windows records events related to starting and stopping of services in the
System Event Log. The following events are often noteworthy:***

``6005`` – ***The event log service was started. This will occur at system boot time, and whenever
the system is manually started. Since the event log service is critical for security, it gets is
own Event ID.***

``6006`` – ***The event log service was stopped. While this obviously occurs at system shutdown
or restart, its occurrence at other times may be indicative of malicious attempts to avoid
logging of the activity or to modify the logs.***

``7034`` – ***A service terminated unexpectedly. The event description will display the name of
the services and may display the number of times that this service has crashed.***

``7036`` – ***A service was stopped or started. While the event log service has its own Event ID,
other services are logged under the same Event ID.***

``7040``- ***The start type for a service was changed. The event description will display the name
of the service that was changed and describe the change that was made.***

``7045`` – ***A service was installed by the system. The name of the service is found in the
Service Name field of the event description, and the full path to the associated executable is
found in the Service File Name field. This can be a particularly important event as many
tools, such as psexec, create a service on the remote system to execute commands.***


**If you have enabled Advanced Audit Policy** ``Configuration > System Audit Policies > System >
Audit Security System Extension in your GPOs``, **Windows 10 and Server 2016/2019 systems will
also record Event ID 4697 in the Security event log.**


### Wireless LAN Auditing
		
***Windows maintains an event log dedicated to wireless local area network (WLAN) activity, and
with rogue access points being a common attack vector for man-in-the-middle and malware attacks,
it may be worth looking at unusual connections on devices with Wi-Fi capability, particularly those
allowed to leave your environment. The log is located at"***

```
%SystemRoot%\System32\winevt\Logs\Microsoft-Windows-WLAN-AutoConfig%4
```

**Operational``.evtx.``
***Event IDs of interest are:***

		
### Wi-Fi connection event IDs
		
>#### Event ID 8001
>##### Description
***WLAN service has successfully connected to a wireless network. The event description
provides the Connection Mode indicating if this was an automatic connection based on a
configured profile (and the associated Profile Name) or a manual connection. The SSID of
the access point, its authentication mechanism, and its encryption mechanism are also
recorded.***

>#### Event ID 8002
>##### Description
***WLAN service failed to connect to a wireless network. Once again, the event description
will contain the Connection Mode, associated Profile Name, and the SSID along with a
Failure Reason field.***


### Process Tracking
		
***Unlike many Linux shells (such as bash) the Windows cmd.exe shell does not maintain a history of
commands run by users. This has created a noticeable gap in the ability of incident handlers to
understand the actions that an attacker takes on a compromised host. The rise of “Living of the
Land” attacks that do not rely on malware but instead use built-in Windows commands has only
made this blind spot more damaging. While in the early days of Windows, auditing process creation
was considered far too system
While not always required on every system, enabling this feature on key systems is increasingly
becoming standard practice in security-conscious environments. This requires setting two separate
Group Policy settings. The first is of course Computer Configuration -> Windows Settings ->
Security Settings -> Local Policies -> Audit Policy -> Audit process tracking. Once enabled, Event
ID 4688 in the Security log provides a wealth of information regarding processes that have been
run on the system:***
```
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/manage/componentupdates/command-line-process-auditing
```

>#### Event ID 4688
>##### Description
***A new process has been created. The event description provides the Process ID and Process
Name, Creator Process ID, Creator Process Name, and Process Command Line (if enabled
separately, as outlined earlier in this section).***

**In addition the Event ID 4688, activation of process tracking may also result in additional Security
log entries from the Windows Filtering Platform related to network connections and listening ports
as follows:**
```

```


	
### Windows Filtering Platform (WFP) event IDs
	
>#### Event ID 5031
>##### Description
***The Windows Firewall Service blocked an application from accepting incoming
connections on the network.***

>#### Event ID 5152
>#### Description
***The WFP blocked a packet.***

>#### Event ID 5154
>##### Description
***The WFP has permitted an application or service to listen on a port for incoming
connections.***

>#### Event ID 5156
>##### Description
***The WFP has allowed a connection.***

>#### Event ID 5157
>##### Description
***The WFP has blocked a connection.***

>#### Event ID 5158
>##### Description
***The WFP has permitted a bind to a local port***

>#### Event ID 5159
>##### Description
***The WFP has blocked a bind to a local port.***


***The event descriptions of the Windows Filtering Platform events are self explanatory and detailed,
including information about the local and remote IPs and port numbers as well as the Process ID
and Process Name involved.***
***As can be seen, the information logged by enabling process tracking auditing can be of immense
value, but can also generate a large amount of data. Experiment with your test environment to come
up with a balance that can appropriately increase security auditing in your production environment.***



### Additional Program Execution Logging
		
***If AppLocker is configured in your environment (a step that can help frustrate an adversary and
should be considered), dedicated AppLocker event logs will be generated as well. Presented in
Event Viewer under Application and Services Logs\Microsoft\Windows\AppLocker, these event
logs are stored with the other event logs in C:\Windows\System32\winevt\Logs and have names
such as Microsoft-Windows- AppLocker%4EXE and DLL.evtx. There are separate logs covering
executables and dynamic-link libraries (DLLs), Microsoft installers (MSI) and scripts, packaged
app deployment, and packaged app execution. The event logs generated will vary depending on
whether AppLocker is set to audit-only mode or blocking mode. Details of the specific event IDs
that may apply to your situation can be found at here.***

***Windows exploit protection is a feature of Windows 10 that can provide excellent defense against a
range of adversary exploitation techniques. This feature can protect both the operating system and
individual applications from common attack vectors, blocking the exploitation when it otherwise
would have resulted in system compromise. Although some features of exploit protection are
enabled by default, many are disabled due to their potential to interfere with legitimate software.
When enabled, this feature logs its activities in the***

***Another option to enhance visibility into processes that run on systems in your environment is to
implement Sysmon, a free utility by Sysinternals, which is now a part of Microsoft. Sysmon can be
freely downloaded here.***
```
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sysmon
```
***When deployed on a system, Sysmon installs as a system service and device driver to generate
event logs related to processes, network connections, and modifications to file creation times. It
creates a new category of logs that are presented in Event Viewer under Applications and Services
Logs\Microsoft\Windows\Sysmon\Operational and is stored in***
```
C:\Windows\System32\winevt\Logs\Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon%4Operational.evtx.
```
***An example of useful event IDs generated by Sysmon include:***

### Auditing PowerShell Use
		
* ***Microsoft continues to increase the amount of logs available surrounding PowerShell to help
combat its nefarious use. Once again, these logging facilities must be enabled via Group Policy,
specifically at ``Computer Configuration -> Policies -> Administrative Templates -> Windows
Components -> Windows PowerShell``. There are three basic categories of logging that may be
available, depending on the version of Windows in question.***

***

#### Module Logging

* ***Logs pipeline execution events;***
* ***Logs to event logs.***

***

#### Script Block Logging
* ***Captures de-obfuscated commands sent to PowerShell;***
* ***Captures the commands only, not the resulting output;***
* ***Logs to event logs.***
***

#### Transcription
* ***Captures PowerShell input and output;***
* ***Will not capture output of outside programs that are run, only PowerShell;***
* ***Logs to text files in user specified location.***
***


***Once enabled, these logs can provide a wealth of information concerning the use of PowerShell on
your systems. If you routinely run lots of PowerShell scripts, this can produce a large volume of
data, so be sure to test and tune the audit facilities to strike a balance between visibility and load
before deploying such changes in production.***

>PowerShell event log entries appear in different event logs. Inside of
```
%SystemRoot%\System32\winevt\ Logs\Microsoft-Windows-PowerShell%4Operational.evtx
you will find two events of particular note:
```

>### Event ID 4103
>#### Description
***Shows pipeline execution from the module logging facility. Includes the user context used 
to run the commands. Hostname field will contain Console if executed locally or will show
if run from a remote system.***

>### Event ID 4104
>#### Description
***Shows script block logging entries. Captures the commands sent to PowerShell, but not the
output. Logs full details of each block only on first use to conserve space. Will show as a
Warning level event if Microsoft deems the activity Suspicious.***
Additional entries can be found in the ``%SystemRoot%\System32\winevt\Logs\Windows
PowerShell.evtx`` log:

>### Event ID 400
>#### Description
Indicates the start of command execution or session. Hostname field shows if (local)
Console or the remote session that caused the execution.

>### Event ID 800
>#### Description
***Shows pipeline execution details. UserID shows account used. Hostname field shows if
(local) Console or the remote session that caused the execution. Since many malicious scripts
encode options with Base64, check the HostApplication field for options encoded with the -
enc or -EncodedCommand parameter.***

##### Remember that PowerShell Remoting requires authenticated access, so look for the associated Account Logon and Logon events as well.

   ## Difference between Authentications vs. Authorization
	
### Authentication
	
***Simple English Meaning: The process or action of verifying the identity of a user or
process. Authentication is the process of proving one’s identity before trying to gain access to a
resource. We see Authentication everywhere in our day to day lives such as:***


* ***1. Passports***
* ***2. ID Cards***
* ***3. Aadhaar Cards etc.***

**In Tech World, we see Authentication in the following scenarios:**
* ***1. Website LogIns***
* ***2. Mobile Phone LogIns***
* ***3. Computer LogIns etc.***

***Generally, Authenticating yourself is just proving to the system that you are the one you are
claiming to be. It normally takes place in the following way: A user tries to Log In to the system
and is asked to present his username and password. When both of these things are entered and are
validated as true by the system, the user is authenticated and is allowed to Log In.***


### ***Types of Authentication***

***1. Single-Factor Authentication: It is the simplest form of Authentication and requires just a
username and password. Once these two are validated, a user is allowed to log in. Example:
Simple website login***

***2. Two-Factor Authentication: This form of Authentication requires an additional piece of
information that only the user knows, along with the username and password. Example:
Logging In a website with the username and password, along with an OTP (One-Time
Password) which is sent to the user’s email id or phone.***

***3. Multi-Factor Authentication: This is the most advanced method of Authentication which
requires two or more levels of security from independent categories of authentication to
grant a user access to the system. This form of authentication utilizes factors that are
independent of each other in order to eliminate any data exposure.***


### Authorization
***Simple English Meaning: Official permission for something to happen, or the act of giving someone official permission for something. The authorization is the process of providing or granting permissions to a user to access a protected resource.***

***Some examples of Authorization are:***

***1. Granting individual access to a specific location in a building***
***2. Allowing a user to access specific parts of a website etc.***

***Authentication and Authorization working Together in Real World Let us take a real-world example where we see both*** ***Authentication and Authorization concepts***
***working together.***
***In offices, when a new employee joins, he is given two things***

* ***1. ID card (Authentication)***
* ***2. Access Card (Authorization)***

***The use of the ID card is to prove the employee’s identity. It contains the name, employee ID and
some other details of the employee. The use of the Access Card is to grant special permissions to an
employee to access specific parts of the office. For example, some employees might not have
permission to access the server room and some employees might have. The Access Card helps in
establishing the relationship between a user and the scope of access he has.***
